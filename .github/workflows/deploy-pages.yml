# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
# 
# This workflow automatically builds and deploys your site to GitHub Pages.
# It works for both static sites and sites that require a build step.
# 
# Features:
# - Auto-detects if your project needs building (looks for package.json)
# - Supports multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js, Jekyll, etc.)
# - Intelligently finds build output directory (dist, build, out, _site)
# - Caches Node.js dependencies for faster builds
# - Handles errors gracefully
#
